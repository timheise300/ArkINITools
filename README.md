# ArkINITools
Tools for generating and validating Ark Survival Evolved INI files.  The ArkSpawnINIBuilder will generate an INI file based on the map name entered by the user, and add all non-native creatures to the map.  Use the ArkINIValidator to ensure the file was generated with the correct format.
